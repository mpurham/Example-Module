# Example Module 

This package shows an example of how to create custom modules and use them in your scripts via Polypad. 

## Usage

The `myModule` has 3 string operations.

1. downcase
2. uppercase
3. camelCase

In the `ExampleModule.js` file we are able to import those functions using the `require` keyword.

## Features and compatability

Simply `downcase`, `uppercase`, or `camelCase` text;
